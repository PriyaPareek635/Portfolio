It is still in the development mode.

My name is Priya Pareek. I'm a Frontend Developer. I was born in Rajasthan and raised in Andhra Pradesh.

I did B.E. in Computer Science from GMR Institute of Technology, Rajam. Then I started working for Anpan, Japan.

I like to travel. I believe travelling gives you a new perspective to everything. You get to know a lot about the different cultures, the cuisines, their history, the language and all the small unique things every place has to offer.

Please stay tuned to until the development completed.
